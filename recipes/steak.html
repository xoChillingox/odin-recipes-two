    <strong><h2>Description</h2></strong>
        <p> Flat iron steak is cut from beef shoulder. To make a flat iron steak, butchers remove the connective tissue to separate the top shoulder blade into two cuts: One is the top blade, the other is the flat iron.</p>

        <p>Flat iron steak is nicely marbled and is less expensive than other steaks, which makes it a popular choice among home cooks. When it's cooked correctly, flat iron steak is wonderfully tender and juicy.</p>
